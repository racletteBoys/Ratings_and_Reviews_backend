### 1.0.0 (2019-10-25):

* **BREAKING** Removed support for Node 6, 7, and 9.

  The minimum supported version is now Node v8. For further information on our support policy, see: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent.

### 0.3.0 (2019-07-18):

* Adds support for DocumentClient API calls to be captured as Datastore segments/metrics.

  Supported calls are: `get`, `put`, `update`, `delete`, `query` and `scan`. These will be named according to the underlying DynamoDB operation that is executed. For example: `get` will be named `getItem`. DocumentClient calls not listed above will still be captured as Externals.

* Fixed issue that would prevent multiple DynamoDB instances from being instrumented.

* Replaced `database_name` with `collection` in DynamoDB attributes.

* Moved `name` property to the root of DynamoDB segment description object.

  Previously, segments were being incorrectly named `"Datastore/operation/DynamoDB/undefined"`, due to the operation name being misplaced.


### 0.2.0 (2019-02-19):

* Added instrumentation for SNS `publish` API.

* Added instrumentation for SQS `sendMessage`, `sendMessageBatch` and
  `receiveMessageBatch` APIs.
