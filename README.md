# Ratings_and_Reviews_backend
Back end code for a ratings and reviews module for a retail clothing website. The layout follows the MVC standard, and the database that I am using is postgreSQL. 

To run this code:

  1. Do npm install from the root.
  2. If using a Node version thats below 8, run "nvm use 12.13" in the terminal.
